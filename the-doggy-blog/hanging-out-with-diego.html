                  <strong>Diego is our sweet and humble superstar. We want to share a below-the-radar glimpse of Diego.
                    We invite you to find a
                    cozy spot and settle in for a light read to get to know Diego a little better.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Diego has always been our sleeping bug. When we first brought him home he would sleep all morning if
                  we let him. We
                  would have to carry him out of bed and down the stairs just to get him down to breakfast. He would not
                  get out of bed on
                  his own accord. Fast forward 21 months and Diego can still be the last one out of bed in the morning
                  with one variance.
                  The difference now is when, AND ONLY WHEN, he hears his bowls cling will get up by himself and trot
                  his way downstairs
                  to his food bowl. It has taken a long time for Diego’s personality to show. We got our first glimpse
                  when Sammy went for
                  a 2 week training course, and the house turned into the Diego show. With Sammy not around to demand
                  all the attention,
                  we completely fell in love with Diego’s humble nature. He has continued to shine from that point on;
                  even when Sammy
                  tries to overpower him with her energy.</p>
                <img src="../img/articles/diego-chilling.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="Diego French Bulldog" />
                <p>Only recently (April 2020) has Diego been eager to join walks. Although, we have discovered his
                  eagerness is driven by
                  the want to lizard hunt. Alas, we are happy he is initiating to join on walks. So much so that he
                  pushes himself too
                  hard for Mom’s comfort at times.</p>
                <p>We are extra cautious of Diego as he has a bad heart. He has a congenital heart murmur that has
                  progressively gotten
                  worse as he has gotten older. We brought him home on the notion he had a Grade 2 heart murmur. Upon
                  the initial
                  consultation with our local veterinarian when we first brought him home (within 48 hours), Diego was
                  given a Grade 4
                  murmur (we understand the diagnosis of heart murmurs is subjective). This year we decided to have our
                  yearly checkup
                  with the Cardiology Department at The University of Florida Small Animal Hospital. We came to this
                  decision based on
                  that fact there is a full time anesthesiologist staff and just in case Diego ever has to have surgery,
                  he will already
                  be an established patient. At this year's checkup (March 5, 2020) he was assigned a Grade 5 murmur
                  with, newly
                  developed, decreased pumping function on the left side, and moderate Pulmonary Stenosis. (Compared to
                  his 1 year
                  checkup, with a different cardiology facility, he was assigned a Grade 4 murmur with moderate-severe
                  Pulmonary
                  Stenosis.)</p>
                  <img class="card-img" src="../img/articles/hanging-out-with-diego-head.jpg" alt="" />
                  <p></p>

                <p>They ran all sorts of blood tests as they had concerns of the fearful DCM (Dilated Cardiomyopathy).
                  As of now he does
                  not have that condition, and his levels of Taurine were sufficient. It was also recommended that we
                  have a checkup with
                  the Internal Medicine Department to help diagnose why he throws up so frequently. Only then are they
                  willing to explore
                  any idea of surgery.</p>
                <p>A cardiologist has said that he has seen dogs with Diego’s condition die suddenly at 2 years of age,
                  and he has seen
                  dogs live to 10 years of with Pulmonary Stenosis. Therefore, we do not know how much time we will have
                  with our special
                  boy so in the meantime we enjoy all the snuggles we can get and try to give him the best life
                  possible.</p>
                  <img class="card-img" src="../img/articles/diego-stretching.jpg" alt="" />
                  <p></p>
                <p>
                  Let’s rewind to the first few months with Diego. There was a time when we thought he was deaf. We
                  would say his name,
                  clap, anything to get his attention and to no success. If he was facing away from us, he would stare
                  into space. If he
                  was facing us, he would stare with his head cocked sideways looking lost with confusion. Diego still
                  does similar
                  things, but we have since come to the conclusion he is very decisive on what he wants to spend his
                  energy on, an old
                  soul at heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we go on walks of any distance, we know Diego wants to come with us, so we put him in his
                  stroller and he rides
                  like the King of the World. We have

                  measure we know how
                  to.</p>
                <p>He also has a family friend who loves and looks forward to having Diego over for the day. He gets to
                  go along on Book
                  Club gatherings, Coffee Dates, Workouts, Acupuncture Appointments, Play Dates and more. They
